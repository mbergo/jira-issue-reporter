Creating a Chrome extension involves several steps and files. The main files we will need are:

- manifest.json: This is the configuration file for the extension. It specifies basic metadata about the extension such as its name, description, version, and permissions it requires.
- popup.html: This is the HTML file that will be displayed when the user clicks on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
- popup.js: This is the JavaScript file that will contain the logic for interacting with the Jira API and updating the popup.html.
- popup.css: This is the CSS file that will style the popup.html.
- README.md: This is the file that will contain instructions on how to install and use the extension.

Let's start with the manifest.json:
